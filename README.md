# Asterisk patch for AMR and AMR-WB

To add a codec for SIP/SDP (m=, rtmap, and ftmp), you create a format module in Asterisk: `codec_amr.patch` (for m= and rtmap) and `res/res_format_attr_amr.c` (for fmtp). However, this requires both call legs to support AMR (pass-through only). If one leg does not support AMR, the call has no audio. Or, if you use the pre-recorded voice and music files of Asterisk, these files cannot be heard, because they are not in AMR but in slin. Therefore, this repository adds not just a format module for the audio-codecs AMR and AMR-WB but a transcoding module as well: `codecs/codec_amr.c`.

This is an implementation of IETF [RFC 4867](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4867). Sometimes, AMR is called AMR Narrowband (AMR-NB). AMR Wideband (ITU-T Recommendation G.722.2) is sometimes abbreviated W-AMR ([GSA](http://www.gsacom.com/hdvoice/)). GSMA Mobile [HD Voice](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?&list=PLj1MyDu3jckpSciPQ1Max0W6HDSaY8-n4) is AMR-WB. Research papers comparing AMR and AMR-WB with other audio codecs: [InterSpeech 2010](http://research.nokia.com/files/public/%5B12%5D_Interspeech%202010_Voice%20Quality%20Evaluation%20of%20Recent%20Open%20Source%20Codecs.pdf), [ICASSP 2010](http://research.nokia.com/files/public/%5B11%5D_ICASSP2010_Voice%20Quality%20Evaluation%20of%20Various%20Codecs.pdf), [InterSpeech 2011](http://research.nokia.com/files/public/%5B16%5D_InterSpeech2011_Voice_Quality_Characterization_of_IETF_Opus_Codec.pdf).

This patch is for Asterisk 13. If you use an older version of Asterisk, and AMR without AMR-WB is sufficient in your case, please, have a look at those patches:

* [Asterisk 11…](http://gist.github.com/airend/ad78f1ea0a3e6c13d230)
* [Asterisk 1.8…](http://sourceforge.net/projects/asterisk-amr/files/)

## Installing the patch

The patch was built on top of Asterisk 13.10. If you use a newer version and the patch fails, please, [report](http://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)!

    cd /usr/src/
    wget downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-13-current.tar.gz
    tar zxf ./asterisk*
    cd ./asterisk*
    sudo apt-get --assume-yes install build-essential autoconf libssl-dev libncurses-dev libnewt-dev libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev uuid-dev libjansson-dev libblocksruntime-dev

Install libraries:

If you do not want transcoding but pass-through only (because of license issues) please, skip this step. To support transcoding, you’ll need to install OpenCORE AMR, for example in Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get --assume-yes install libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev libvo-amrwbenc-dev

Apply all patches:

    wget github.com/traud/asterisk-amr/archive/master.zip
    unzip -qq master.zip
    rm master.zip
    cp --verbose --recursive ./asterisk-amr*/* ./
    patch -p0 <./codec_amr.patch
    patch -p0 <./build_tools.patch

Run the bootstrap script to re-generate configure:

    ./bootstrap.sh

Configure your patched Asterisk:

    ./configure

Enable slin16 in menuselect for transcoding, for example via:

    make menuselect.makeopts
    ./menuselect/menuselect --enable-category MENUSELECT_CORE_SOUNDS

Compile and install:

    make
    sudo make install

## Testing
You can test AMR-WB out of the box using

A.  (Google Android) [CSipSimple](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.csipsimple)

B.  (Google Android) [CounterPath Bria](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bria.voip)

C.  (Apple iOS) [CounterPath Bria](http://itunes.apple.com/app/bria-iphone-edition-voip-softphone/id373968636)

D.  (Windows Phone 8) [Linphone](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appId=99661466-8c5c-489b-a567-569c1f480d29)

On ingress, this module supports the octet-aligned mode and the bandwidth-efficient mode. Currently on egress, only the bandwidth-efficient mode is advertised when transcoding. However, if the originating party supports AMR, it’s mode is passed transparently. Because Linphone supports only the octet-aligned mode, but does not honor the line `fmtp` in SDP, the mode is not negotiated correctly and ingress calls create distorted audio in Linphone. This bug is reported to the Linphone team. However, these VoIP/SIP clients offer G.722 and Opus, which should be used for wide-band audio instead. G.722 transcoding is build into Asterisk already. Opus can be [added as transcoding module…](http://github.com/seanbright/asterisk-opus/)

Actually, this repository was created for Nokia Mobile Phones which support AMR (since the year 2006) and AMR-WB (since the year 2009) in VoIP/SIP, like:

* [Nokia Asha 503](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_asha_503-5794.php) (Asha Software Platform),
* [Nokia 303](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_asha_303-4278.php) (Nokia Series 40),
* [Nokia E75](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_e75-2688.php) (Symbian/S60), and [Nokia Belle](http://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?sOSes=5&sOSversions=5400).

## What is missing
This transcoding module is shoddy work. Therefore, please, double-check the source of `codecs/codec_amr.c` for any feature you need. For example IETF [RFC 4867](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4867) offers frame CRC, robust sorting and interleaving. If you need this, please, [add](http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) that code or [report](http://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) the device/app which requires this. I simply do not have a testing device for this. Several AMR frames per payload (compound payload) are another issue, for example when FEC or a packetization time (`ptime`) longer than 20 ms are used. The transcoding module works for me and contains everything I need. If you cannot code yourself, however, a feature is missing for you, please, [report](http://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and send me at least a testing device.

## Thanks goes to
* teams of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), OpenCORE AMR, Debian Multimedia, and Ubuntu for providing the libraries.
* Asterisk team: Thanks to their efforts and architecture this AMR module was written in one working day.
* [Sean Bright](http://github.com/seanbright/asterisk-opus/) provided the starting point with his Opus patch.
* [Юрий Остапчук](http://code.google.com/p/fs-mod-opencore-amr/source/browse/mod_opencore_amr/mod_opencore_amr.c) provided an code example for the bandwidth-efficient mode.
